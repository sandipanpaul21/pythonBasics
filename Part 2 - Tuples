# Tuples

t = 1,2.5,'data'
t   # (1, 2.5, 'data')
type(t) # tuple

# tuple has a built-in index, with the help of which you can retrieve single or multiple elements of the tuple
t[2] # 'data'
type(t[2])  # str

# Zero based numbering - Python uses zero-based numbering schemes. For example, the first element of a tuple object has index value 0.

# Only two special methods that this object type provides: count and index. 
#The first counts the number of occurrences of a certain object and the second gives the index value of the first appearance of it:
t.count('data') # 1
t.index('data') # 2

# NOTE - Tuple objects are not very flexible since, once defined, they cannot be changed easily.
